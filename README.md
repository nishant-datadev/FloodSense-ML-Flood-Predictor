# FloodSense: Predicting Flood Risk in India using Machine Learning
Machine Learning based flood predictor that predicts the flood risk in India using rainfall, weather and hydrology data. This project explores real-world climate data, builds a predictive Machine Learning model and visualizes the flood-prone zones that aims to predict the likelihood of flooding in different parts of India based on climate and environmental data. Project built fro scratch and involves data analysis, modeling and climate-tech.
